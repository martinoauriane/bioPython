## Bioinformatics

Bioinformatics is defined as the application of tools of computation and analysis to the capture and interpretation of biological data. It is an interdisciplinary field, which harnesses computer science, mathematics, physics, and biology.

Bioinformatics is essential for management of data in modern biology and medicine. It's a pretty recent branch of biology that encompasses the use of algebraic, analytic, and computing approaches to the processing and interpretation of biological information.

Large commercial enterprises such as pharmaceutical companies employ bioinformaticians to perform and maintain the large scale and complicated bioinformatic needs of these industries. A fundamental activity is sequence analysis of DNA and proteins using various programs and databases available on the world wide web.
With an ever-increasing need for constant input from bioinformatic experts, most biomedical laboratories may soon have their own in-house bioinformatician. The individual researcher, beyond a basic acquisition and analysis of simple data, would certainly need external bioinformatic advice for any complex analysis.

## An evolving discipline

The escalating amount of data from the genome projects has necessitated computer databases that feature rapid assimilation, usable formats and algorithm software programs for efficient management of biological data.

Because of the diverse nature of emerging data, no single comprehensive database exists for accessing all this information. However, a growing number of databases that contain helpful information for clinicians and researchers are available.

Bioinformatics is an evolving discipline, and expert bioinformaticians now use complex software programs for retrieving, sorting out, analysing, predicting, and storing DNA and protein sequence data.

#### Open-source

Many free and open-source software tools have existed and continued to grow since the 1980s.The combination of a continued need for new algorithms for the analysis of emerging types of biological readouts, the potential for innovative in silico experiments, and freely available open code bases have created opportunities for research groups to contribute to both bioinformatics regardless of funding.

Open-source bioinformatics software includes Bioconductor, BioPerl, Biopython, BioJava, BioJS, BioRuby, Bioclipse, EMBOSS, .NET Bio, Orange with its bioinformatics add-on, Apache Taverna, UGENE and GenoCAD.

#### A bit of history

Since the bacteriophage Phage Φ-X174 was sequenced in 1977,[24] the DNA sequences of thousands of organisms have been decoded and stored in databases.
With the growing amount of data, it long ago became impractical to analyze DNA sequences manually.

#### Sequences storage

Databases are essential for bioinformatics research and applications. Databases exist for many different information types, including DNA and protein sequences, molecular structures, phenotypes and biodiversity. Databases can contain both empirical data (obtained directly from experiments) and predicted data (obtained from analysis of existing data). They may be specific to a particular organism, pathway or molecule of interest. Alternatively, they can incorporate data compiled from multiple other databases.

Before sequences can be analyzed, they are obtained from a data storage bank, such as GenBank.

#### Evolutionary biology

Evolutionary biology is the study of the origin and descent of species, as well as their change over time. Informatics has assisted evolutionary biologists by enabling researchers to trace the evolution of a large number of organisms by measuring changes in their DNA, rather than through physical taxonomy or physiological observations alone,

### Genome analysis for cancer understanding

In healthcare, clinical bioinformaticians work within a wider team including clinical geneticists and laboratory scientists to help provide answers for patients diagnosed with rare disease or cancer.

The main role of the clinical bioinformatician is to create and use computer programs and software tools to filter large quantities of genomic data – usually gathered through next-generation sequencing methods, such as whole genome sequencing (WGS) or whole exome sequencing. In doing so, bioinformaticians aim to find meaning in this overwhelming amount of information and provide clinically actionable solutions to help patients.

Bioinformatics is essential for understanding cancer genomics and shaping future cancer therapies. Bioinformatics approaches can transform vast quantities of biological data into comprehensive models, providing insights into cancer and the genotype-phenotype relationships crucial for identifying cancer-driving alterations and therapeutic targets.

## Into DNA

Deoxyribonucleic acid (abbreviated DNA) is the molecule that carries genetic information for the development and functioning of an organism. DNA is made of two linked strands that wind around each other to resemble a twisted ladder — a shape known as a double helix.

We are all far more alike than we are different? In fact, the DNA from any two people is 99.9% identical. The differing 0.1% contains variations that influence our uniqueness, which when combined with our environmental and social contexts give us our abilities, our health, our behavior.

### Amino Acis

Amino acis are the building blocks of proteins. The primary structure can be easily determined from the sequence of codons on the DNA gene that codes for it.
There are 20 different amino acids. A protein consists of one or more chains of amino acids. Some amino acids can be synthesized in the body, but others (essential amino acids) cannot and must be obtained from a person’s diet.

A peptide is a short chain of amino acids (typically 2 to 50) linked by chemical bonds (called peptide bonds). A longer chain of linked amino acids (51 or more) is a polypeptide.

### Proteins

Proteins are large, complex molecules that play many important roles in the body. They are critical to most of the work done by cells and are required for the structure, function and regulation of the body’s tissues and organs. A protein is made up of one or more long, folded chains of amino acids (each called a polypeptide), whose sequences are determined by the DNA sequence of the protein-encoding gene.
